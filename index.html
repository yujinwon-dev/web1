<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>WEB is a computer programming language derived from Pascal created by Donald E. Knuth and notably used to code T E X and Metafont . This is one of the first implementations of what Knuth calls "   literary programming   ", in which descriptive text is written and includes computer code rather than the reverse (usually the code contains descriptive text), so as to be more convenient. to read instead of being organized in the order required by the compiler.

In short: with WEB, the code has been arranged so that the user can understand. With Pascal , it was arranged so that the computer could understand. 1

WEB is made up of two programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from WEB sources, and WEAVE, which produces TeX documents.

Derived versions as CWEB or Web2C, used in several TeX distributions, allow to translate the WEB code C .</p>
