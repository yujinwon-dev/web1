<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language of scripts mainly used in web pages interactive
  and as such is an essential part of web applications . Along with HTML and CSS technologies ,
   JavaScript is sometimes considered one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    A large majority of websites use it, and the majority of web browsers have a JavaScript
    engine dedicated to interpret it, regardless of any security considerations that may arise.
It is an object- to- prototype oriented language  : the bases of the language and its main interfaces are provided by objects .
However, unlike an object oriented language, base objects are not instances of classes.
Each base object (eg the document or windows object) has its own model which will allow it
to instantiate child objects using constructors using its properties. For example, the prototyping property
will allow them to create custom heir objects .
In addition, functions are first-class objects . Language supports the object ,
imperative and functional paradigm . JavaScript is the language with the largest ecosystem
thanks to its npm dependency manager , with around 500,000 packages inaugust 20175 .
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich . It was standardized under the name ECMAScript
in June 1997 by Ecma International in the ECMA-262 standard. In June 2020, the ECMA-262 standard was in its 11th edition.
JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript, the one implemented by the Mozilla Foundation .
Microsoft's implementation of ECMAScript (in Internet Explorer up to version is called JScript ,
while Adobe Systems' implementation is called ActionScript .
JavaScript is also used for servers with the use (for example) of Node.js or Deno.</p>
